            with the payment terms provided to you for the Software:
        </p>
        <p>
            Payments will be billed to you and your account will be debited when you subscribe and provide your

            information that we obtain. DAVO will automatically renew your subscription at the then-current rates,

        </p>

        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px">
            ADDITIONAL TERMS
        </h4>
        <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that DAVO does not provide professional tax opinions or tax management advice
            specific to the facts and circumstances of your business. You are encouraged to conduct due diligence and
            seek the assistance of qualified tax counsel or accounting professionals on matters requiring professional advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the term of the Agreement, you shall transmit to DAVO any information that is to be included in
            your tax returns (“Tax Data”). DAVO shall compile such Tax Data and prepare and file periodic tax returns
            (as required by the state in which your are filing your returns), on behalf of you. You agree to provide
            designated bank account information (“Bank Account”) and routing number for the purpose of paying
            outstanding tax obligations. By accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you agree that
            DAVO may automatically initiate the ACH transfer of the tax amounts due (“Tax Funds”) from the Bank Account
            on a daily basis. If at any time during reconciliation of your Bank Account a balance is found to be owed,
            you agree to immediately fund the Bank Account such amount owed for withdrawal by us. DAVO may hold the
            Tax Funds withdrawn from the Bank Account for taxes due in an interest bearing trust account prior to
            disbursement to the taxing authority. Any interest earned on such account shall accrue for the benefit
            and be the sole property of DAVO. DAVO acknowledges and agree that all Tax Funds received from you belong
            to, and will be held in trust for the benefit of, the individual taxing authorities to which such Tax Funds
            are due and that the Tax Funds shall not be commingled with DAVO’s general funds but may be deposited with
            funds also held in trust on behalf of other taxpayer customers of DAVO.
        </p>
        <p>
            DAVO will not provide funds to pay your taxes due. If for any reason the Tax Funds are not available to
            DAVO in the Bank Account at the time of withdrawal, DAVO will remit your returns without payment and it
            will be your responsibility to make payments directly to the taxing authorities. You acknowledge and agree
            that DAVO will not be responsible for any assessments (including, but not limited to, all penalties and
            interest) due as a result of remitting returns without payment. Accordingly, You hereby releases and holds
            harmless DAVO and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees from any assessments
            (including, but not limited to, penalties and interest) assessed against You as a result of returns filed
            without payment because of Your funding delays or because the Bank Account did not have sufficient funds
            to pay tax amounts owed by You. In addition, on behalf of You and its successors and assigns, You waive any
            claim against DAVO and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees related to the foregoing.
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, DAVO reserves the right to immediately terminate this
            Agreement or take other action to mitigate exposure to loss if tax amounts due are not properly and
            sufficiently funded by You.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transactions rejected due to insufficient funds will be charged $3.00 per rejected transaction. This is in
            addition to any fees or charges initiated by your bank. DAVO will net the charge out of our monthly/quarterly
            filing reconciliation if possible. Otherwise DAVO will ACH debit the sum total of the monthly rejected
            transaction fees from your bank account. DAVO urges you to contact us if you know your account is not going
            to be funded or if you are changing bank accounts. This will help us mitigate transaction rejection.
        </p>
        <p>
            You acknowledge that you receive all notices relating to your tax returns directly from taxing authorities.
            Accordingly, you agree to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless DAVO and its affiliates, subsidiaries,
            officers, directors and employees from any assessments (including, but not limited to, all penalties and
            interest) assessed against you as a result of or based on: (a) your failure to immediately deliver to DAVO
            any notice from a taxing authority; or (b) your election to manage notices from taxing authorities on its
            own. In addition, on behalf of you and your successors and assigns, you waives any claim against DAVO and
            its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors and employees related to the foregoing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may tell you about other DAVO services. You may be offered other services, products, or promotions by
            DAVO (“DAVO Services”). Additional terms and conditions and fees may apply. With some DAVO Services you
            may upload or enter data such as names, addresses and phone numbers, purchases, etc., to the Internet.
            You grant DAVO permission to use information about your business and experience to help us to provide the
            DAVO Services to you and to enhance the Software. You grant DAVO permission to combine your business data,
            if any, with that of others in a way that does not identify you or any individual personally. You also grant
            DAVO permission to share or publish summary results relating to research data and to distribute or license
            such data to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            DAVO may be required by law to send you communications about the Software or Third Party Products.
            You agree that DAVO may send these communications to you via email or by posting them on our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will manage your passwords and accept updates. You are responsible for securely managing your
            password(s) for access to the Software and to contact DAVO If you become aware of any unauthorized
            access to your account. The Software may periodically be updated with tools, utilities, improvements,
            third party applications, or general updates to improve the Software. You agree to receive these updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            You acknowledge that DAVO is dependent on you and third parties to effectively provide the Software and
            that there are factors outside of DAVO’s control that affect the Software, including, but not limited to
            the following: (a) the risks inherent with the Internet; (b) the proper operation, availability and
            function of your ISP, network, hardware, software (including, but not limited to, business or accounting
            software); (c) your accurate completion of set-up forms, your correct configuration of the Software and
            your performance of all of its obligations under this Agreement; and (d) state and local governmental
            agencies to timely update and provide tax rate information. You acknowledge that DAVO is not responsible
            for any damages related to the operation of any third party software or hardware used by you in the Software.

            SERVICE SUSPENSION AND SECURITY
        </h4>
        <p>
            Except as otherwise agreed in this Agreement, in addition to DAVO’s right to terminate or suspend the rights
            to the use of the Software under this Agreement, you acknowledges that: (i) your access to, and use of, the
            Software, may be suspended for the duration of any unanticipated or unscheduled downtime or unavailability
            of any portion or all of the Software for any reason, including, but not limited to, as a result of power
            outages, system failures or other interruptions; (ii) DAVO shall also be entitled, without any liability to
            you, to suspend access to any portion or all of the Software at any time, on a system-wide basis: (A) for
            scheduled maintenance and updates to permit DAVO to conduct maintenance or make modifications to the Software;
            (B) in the event of a denial of service attack or other attack on the Software or other event that DAVO
            determines, in its sole discretion, may create a risk to the Software, to you or any other customer if
            the Software were not suspended; or (C) in the event that DAVO determines that the Software is prohibited
            by law or DAVO otherwise determines that it is necessary or prudent to do so for legal or regulatory reasons
            (collectively, “Service Suspensions”). Without limitations to the disclaimers in this Agreement, DAVO shall

            Data from unauthorized access, (ii) routinely archive your customer data and Tax Data, and (iii) keep your
            software that you use to run the Software current with the latest security patches or updates. DAVO shall
            have no liability to you for any unauthorized access or use, corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of a
