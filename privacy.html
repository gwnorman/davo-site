                    PRIVACY POLICY
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO Technologies LLC (“DAVO”) has established this Privacy Policy and informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way information about you, including from your online activity is collected and how that information is used by DAVO. This statement is readily available on our davotechnologies.com home page. Our Online Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2014.
                </p>

                <h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px">
                    1. Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Your use of the DAVO site and/or your registration for DAVO products constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the DAVO website or any of our DAVO products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DAVO may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised statement here, with an updated revision date. If we make significant changes to our Statement that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an e-mail and/or posting a notice on our corporate website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition DAVO will seek a customer’s prior consent, by e-mail, for any new uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer prior to the change. DAVO will notify customers by e-mail of changes to this policy that will affect information collected from them in the future. In certain circumstances, however, DAVO will not inform and obtain the consent of the customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A customer may withdraw his, her or its consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@davotechnologies.com"> info@davotechnologies.com</a>. Please note that, if you do, DAVO may suspend its provision of products to you.

                    2. Accountability
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO collects, at the time of your registration and your sign-on to its web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies you) including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, home or work address, telephone number, and information about your computer hardware and software (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses).
                </p>
                <p>
                    DAVO has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that DAVO will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information that is sent for processing by third parties on behalf of DAVO.
                </p>

                <h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px">
                    3. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO collects and uses personal information for the following “Privacy Policy Purposes”:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to develop and provide our web site and our products for our customers;</li>
                    <li>to fulfill your requests for products or information;</li>
                    <li>to communicate with customers and site visitors, when necessary, and to inform customers of upgrades, as well as of other products available from DAVO, its affiliates and third parties.</li>
                    <li>to bill accounts and maintain payment records;</li>
                    <li>to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request;</li>
                    <li>to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our reasonable belief, that you are violating the rights of any third party or any of the agreements or policies that govern your use of the DAVO site or any DAVO product or service;</li>
                    <li>to protect the services, products or rights of DAVO, including but not limited to the security or integrity of the DAVO site; and</li>
                    <li>to identify and resolve technical problems concerning the DAVO site and its products.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    DAVO also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Privacy Policy Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us
                </p>

                <h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px">
                    4. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Privacy Policy Purposes. DAVO does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

                    5. Disclosure, Processing and Retention
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO does not sell, rent or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone else, except:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Privacy Policy Purposes (listed in Section 2, above);with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your personally identifiable information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies; Whenever we provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, we require that they protect it consistent with the types of protections outlined in this policy and do not allow them to use such information for any purposes inconsistent with this policy.</li>
                    <li>access to your information to do that work and improve services they provide;</li>
                    <li>to DAVO employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on DAVO behalf for any of the Privacy Policy Purposes, include to do the work and improve services they provide;</li>
                    <li>as necessary if DAVO has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with DAVO’s rights or property, other users of DAVO web site, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and</li>
                    <li>to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that DAVO or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from our database), DAVO will keep your personal information in its archives. Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove DAVO compliance with any applicable law.
                </p>


                <h4 style="padding-bottom: 10px">
                    6. Accuracy of Personal Information
                </h4>
                <p>
                    DAVO will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Privacy Policy Purposes and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. Customers are responsible for informing DAVO about changes to their personal information. You can do this by sending e-mail to info@davotechnologies.com DAVO will use new or updated personal information it receives from customers to update its own records.

                    7. “Do Not Track” Settings
                </h4>
                <p>
                    “Do Not Track” is a preference you can set in your browser to let the sites you visit know that you do not want them collecting your personally identifiable information.  DAVO does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track signals. Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that the DAVO website does not track your movement within the DAVO website. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by visiting the following links:

                    If DAVO is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney–client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.
